# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 

This repository contains the implementation of various data structures and algorithms (DSA) using the C programming language. The focus is on understanding how data structures work and how they are implemented using different algorithms.

## Current Topics

### 1. **Stack Implementation**
   - This section includes the implementation of a stack data structure.
   - The stack is implemented using an array with a fixed size (`MAX`).
   - It includes the following operations:
     - **Push**: Adds an element to the stack.
     - **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
     - **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
     - **Display**: Displays all the elements in the stack.
     - **Check if Empty/Full**: Validates if the stack is empty or full(Stack Overflow/Underflow).
